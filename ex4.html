    <h1 style="color: azure; background-color: brown;">Basic Formatting using Inline CSS</h1>
   <div style="background-color: orangered;padding: 30px;"> Inline, internal, and external CSS are three ways to apply styling to HTML documents.
         **Inline CSS** is used by adding the `style` attribute directly to an HTML element, allowing quick and specific styling
         , but it is difficult to maintain and not reusable. **Internal CSS** is written within a 
          tag inside the `<head>` section of an HTML document. It is useful for applying styles to a single page
          and is more organized than inline CSS, though it cannot be reused across multiple pages.
        **Summary:**
Inline, internal, and external CSS are methods used to style HTML elements. Inline CSS applies styles directly within the element, internal CSS uses a ` tag in the HTML file's `<head>`, and external CSS links to a separate stylesheet. While inline CSS is quick but hard to manage, internal CSS is suitable for single-page styling. External CSS is the most efficient and maintainable for larger projects, allowing for reusable and organized code.

            This is the most efficient method for large websites, as it keeps HTML clean, promotes reusability, and simplifies maintenance.
